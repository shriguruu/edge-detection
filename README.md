# ‚ú® Custom Canny Edge Detection Web App

This project is an interactive web application that detects edges in images using a **custom, from-scratch implementation** of the Canny edge detection algorithm.

It allows users to upload an image and instantly see the detected edges, showcasing a deep understanding of the underlying computer vision principles **without relying on pre-built library functions** for the core logic.

## üöÄ Features

- **Upload Images**: Users can upload images in various formats (JPG, PNG, etc.).
- **Real-Time Edge Detection**: Applies the custom Canny algorithm and displays the result instantly.
- **Side-by-Side View**: Shows the original and edge-detected images next to each other for easy comparison.
- **From-Scratch Algorithm**: The core edge detection logic is built using NumPy, demonstrating the fundamental steps of the Canny algorithm.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: For creating and running the interactive web application.
- **NumPy**: For all numerical operations and implementing the Canny algorithm from scratch.
- **Pillow & OpenCV**: For image manipulation and handling.
